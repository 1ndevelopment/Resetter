<h2>Other features:</h2>
- Manifest and userlist updater: By clicking on *"help"*>*"update files"*
- Easy install: Basically, you will be able to build your own list of apps that you'd like to mass install after a reset or fresh install. It can also be used anytime to install a package. If you saved a backup file using the save feature prior to your reset or fresh install, you will be able to restore the apps from that list if they're available to install.

- Easy PPA: With this feature, you can search launchpad.net for PPAs containing apps directly from resetter and install it into your system. It will also grab the ppa's key automatically. This eliminates the need of using a terminal to add ppas from launchpad making distros more user friendly.

- Source Editor: It is a normal editor that can disable, enable, or remove ppas from a user's system but what makes this different from other source editors is that you can search for the ppa that you want to edit.
